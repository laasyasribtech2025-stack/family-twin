I decided to walk 4 miles through the blizzard to retrieve kerosene for the heater and milk for your father who was just a toddler. It was so cold my eyelashes froze shut. But when I got back and fired up that heater, the room warmed up, and your grandma made us hot cocoa. It taught me that a family can get through any storm if they work together.",

It felt like nothing, but over forty years, that seed grew into the college fund that paid for Arthur and Sarah's university. Start early, stay steady, and don't panic when the market takes a dip.
